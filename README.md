## Description

There is a Docker file for setting up and running a local Mongo database if you want. You should run docker-compose up from the project root

There is a directory (itpatagonia-database) with two collections that you could need: companies and transfers.

Once you run npm install && npm start, you will be able to see the Swagger collection in localhost:3000/api

You can run test too: npm test
